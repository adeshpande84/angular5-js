# Test app for Angular 5 app development without Typescript

This app is just an experimental app to see how easy it is to develop angular 4 apps using just ES6 (Latest version of Javascript) 

**This app does not use Typescript**

Technologies used:

	- Angular 5
	- Babel (Compiles ES6 javascript code to ES5 javascript so that is works on browsers)
	- Webpack (Module bundler - takes the modules defined in different js files and bundles them into one file which can be used on the browser)
	- Express (Used here only to startup the server and serve the static file)
